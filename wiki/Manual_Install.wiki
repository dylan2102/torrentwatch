==Pre Install==
You will need to configure torrentwatch from your PC. Here we are going to setup so you can access that page from your PC.  This is also used to call the install routine

  # open your hosts file
   * On Windows this is C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
   * On Linux/Unix this is /etc/hosts
  # Add the folowing line, making sure to use your PCH's ip
   * 192.168.1.104 localhost.drives popcorn
  # Bookmark http://localhost.drives:8883/HARD_DISK/tw-iface.php

==To install via FTP==
  # decompress the zip
  # ftp to your popcorn, and upload these 3 files from the zip to your PCH
    * tw.scripts.tar
    * torrentwatch-installer.html
    * torrentwatch-installer.cgi
  # send the command "site chmod 755 torrentwatch-installer.cgi" through ftp
  # Go to [http://localhost.drives:8883/HARD_DISK/torrentwatch-installer.cgi?install] *OR*
  # On your popcorn remote push the source button
  # Select HARD_DISK
  # Select the 4th icon, which is files
  # Select torrentwatch-installer.html
  # Select Run from HARD_DISK
  # Select Install to HARD_DISK

If you get an error of "Request cannot be processed"
This means the torrentwatch-installer.cgi is not executable. Redo step 3.

  # decompress the zip to the base dir of the USB stick
  # Push the source button on your PCH remote
  # Remember which USB_DRIVE is being offered(A, A-1, B, B-1)
   * I'm using A-1 for this example
  # Select USB_DRIVE_A-1
  # Select the 4th icon, which is files
  # Select torrentwatch-installer.html
  # Select Run from USB_DRIVE_A-1
  # Select Install to HARD_DISK
