#summary How to install Torrent Watch on platforms other than the NMT
#labels Phase-Deploy

Torrentwatch was created for the NMT platform, but versions after 0.7.7 should work on any unix style system(freebsd, linux, etc.).  On other systems the only valid client will be the transmission >= 1.30 client.

When you download the transmission package, only one file in the package is important, tw.scripts.tar.  This tar contains the torrentwatch scripts.  You will want to extract it to a directory that is accessable from a http server and has CGI enabled.  You will also want to have php installed.

Once the script is in place, load up index.cgi in your web browser and make sure it loads up.  After the first load it should have created a directory ~/.torrents (from whichever user http runs it as).  This is where torrentwatch will store configuration, cache, and history data.  You can change it in php/platform.c the platform_getUserRoot() function.
