Much of the framework is borrowed from the Kohana framework(http://kohanaphp.com)
Unfortunatly, Kohana was way too heavy for the NMT platform.

Tw with a exceptionally basic  framework took roughly .7secconds and 650k of memory on NMT
Kohana took just over 1s and 780k of memory just to display the welcome page(no real controller)

As such i tried to find a happy medium by using the Koahana basic setup and a few of their classes
