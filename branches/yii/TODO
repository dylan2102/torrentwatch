  Will have favorites to start tvShows, movies, and items that match strings.
  Will be able to start nzb's and torrents from the same instance and allow
  configuration of the way the clients are used(executables, config files, etc)
  Will be able to remember when, why, and how feedItems were started regardless of other
  models continued existance in the database
Completed classic webui to work with the new backend
NMT view to be partially completed, but not fully usable in first release

TODO
-----
on feedItem creation if tv_episode.status = downloaded, set status to duplicate
when tv_episode.status changes to downloaded, change all feedItems pointing to it of nomatch to duplicate
Write inspector ajax action to get specific data from database
Fix and Document LED colors in webui
Fix css selectors in javascript to point to correct items
Create download history table and add to it from downloadManager

Better handling of multiple qualitys

Future TODO's after first release
-----------------------------------

favoriteTvShow quality fallback.  example: if set to hdtv, but we only know about a 720p release allow that to go through after X(4?) hours of not seeing an hdtv release
new version of deep directories that takes a user formatted string (like mp3 renamers) and string replacement to generate the title
