running the unit tests makes excessive use of fixtures which hit the 
hard disk fairly hard.  Suggest using a ramdisk to store the test
database with something like the following:

cd protected/data
mkdir ramdisk
sudo mke2fs /dev/ram0
sudo mount /dev/ram0 ramdisk
cp source-test.db source-test.db.BACKUP
mv source-test.db ramdisk
ln -s ramdisk/source-test.db

Tests that take 30 secconds with the db on disk take < 1s on ramdisk
